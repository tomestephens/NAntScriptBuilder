NAnt Script Builder

A rather simple translation of a Visual Studio project or .NET code file into an NAnt Script. The idea is that it allows
you to have the ease and comfort of working in Visual Studio but still allows you to avoid compiled version of NAnt extensions
which can at times be problematic.

Current implementation is rather crude and could easily miss required references. For now, it should be expected that you will
need to manually review added references and test to ensure that the translation worked correctly.
